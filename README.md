Experiment with AWS CodePipeline
This project is part of a college experiment to explore and understand the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process using AWS CodePipeline. It demonstrates how to automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications.

Key Features:
* CI/CD Workflow: Automated process for code changes from commit to deployment.
* AWS Integration: Utilizes AWS CodePipeline, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.
* Hands-On Learning: Focuses on gaining practical experience with cloud-based CI/CD tools.
  
Objective:
To learn and implement a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, enhancing understanding of automated software delivery practices.
